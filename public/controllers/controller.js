More of a village than a restaurant, the sheer size of the place is almost as impressive as its mind-bogglingly intricate and authentic d√©cor, theatrical service and downright delicious traditional Colombian cuisine - and one hell of a party. Invariably filled with locals and tourists alike, Andr√©s seamlessly blurs the line between dinner and fiesta with fantastic Latin music, indoor and outdoor dance floors and seating, and numerous themed areas. This is a rite of passage for anyone visiting the city. Here are some recommendations to bear in mind if you find yourself getting lost in the extensive menu. For a large group, try the 'tost√≥n con todo', a pizza-sized piece of fried plantain, topped with avocado, Colombian frijoles, chicharrones, and more national delicacies. Then there's the unmissable 'lomo al trapo', a choice cut of local beef, coated with condiments and wrapped in a cloth, then thrown straight onto the fire. The result is some of the most tender, flavoursome and unorthodox beef you've ever tried. To wash all that down, you want to order some 'cerveza michelada', lager freshened up with lime juice, salt and optional hot sauce. Or, if you need some Dutch courage before trying out your Latin dance moves, order a bottle of aguardiente, our local spirit, flavoured with aniseed and packing quite a punch.",

The bottle of beer in one hand is essential for balance and focus, we're told (and is preferably renewed between rounds). The explosives are harmless but certainly make things pretty exciting. The combination makes for a hilarious evening - and who knows, maybe you've got a hidden talent for it? We can organise it all for you, with transportation, tour guide and local beer included.",

Delicious traditional eateries and colourful colonial architecture will immerse you in Colombian culture and give you a taste of where this nation came from and what it's all about.

A gleaming white church high up on the green Andean mountains flanking Bogota's eastern edge, it can be accessed either by cable car or by funicular (or, if you're feeling pumped, you can head up on foot). Not only will you be rewarded by the best views the city has to offer, but you'll also be able to explore the church and understand the relevance of Catholicism in this country. Should the fresh Andean air start to feel a little too fresh, you can duck into the quirky 1920s-style restaurant perched elegantly on the mountainside to continue enjoying the vista from a cosier spot, with a drink in hand. Or if you prefer something more low-key, a mini-market behind the church offers local delicacies such as 'canelazo', a sort of cinnamon-infused Colombian hot toddy. It's intended to cure any altitude sickness you may have. We can't vouch for that, but we will agree that a dash of aguardiente tends to cure most things.
